EATING OUT CALCULATOR
-------------------------
Eating out is a world of plus-plus. 
When you see a dish that cost X,
you know you won't pay X amount,
but usually 20% more, to account for
taxes, tips/service charges.
That can be annoying, especially 
if you are on budget.

Now, let's say you only have X amount
of money you are WILLING TO SPEND
on that occassion of eating out.
Let's figure out the net price
of the food (and drink, if you don't BYB)
you REALLY can order to 
satisfy your budget constraint.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:
-------------
1. GST (INDONESIA): 10% of total bill + service charge
2. Service Charge: at most 10% from total unsettled bill
3. Drinks: on average, may eat up to 35% of your whole unsettled bill
(if you decide (and the unwritten rules, you should) order one).
4. Food: The remaining balance after being deducted from GST, service charge & drinks.

MENU
------
- HTML & CSS: displaying the calculator in a rustic, 
centrist-style of display.Generating a number-only input 
(budget) and radio option of buying drinks decision.
- JavaScript & DOM: utilizing getElementById, getElementByName 
and flagging to extract HTML form inputs and generate
probable expenses.
